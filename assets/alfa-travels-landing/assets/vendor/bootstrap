The directory `/alfa-travels-landing/alfa-travels-landing/assets/vendor/bootstrap` is typically used to store the Bootstrap framework files. Since you have not specified any particular files to include, I will create a basic structure that includes the necessary Bootstrap files.

Here are the contents for the `/alfa-travels-landing/alfa-travels-landing/assets/vendor/bootstrap` directory:

- bootstrap.min.css
- bootstrap.bundle.min.js

You can download the latest Bootstrap files from the official Bootstrap website or use a package manager like npm to install them. 

If you need specific files or further customization, please let me know!
